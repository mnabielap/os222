1. [Operating System Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/index.htm)<br>
An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. 
An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, 
memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral 
devices such as disk drives and printers.

2. [Operating system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
An operating system (OS) is a type of system software that controls how computer hardware 
and software resources are used and offers basic services to other software applications.

3. [Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch1.pptx)<br>
This slide is a good introduction for understanding OS. With this slide I learn 
more about the OS and its environment as well as the hardware

4. [What defines an Operating System?](https://rahmatm.samik-ibrahim.vlsm.org/2021/07/what-defines-operating-system.html)<br>
The operating system is a layer of software that comes preinstalled on computers 
and is responsible for giving user programs a better, simpler, cleaner model of 
the computer and for handling all the resources already described.

5. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
By the beginning of the 1950s, computers had become so quick that manually loading 
programs using punch cards was frequently quicker than actually running them. 
The operating system (or OS), which is only a program with special rights that 
enables it to run and manage other programs, provided the solution.

## WEEK-01

1. [10 Linux Terminal Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU)<br>
There are several Linux commands that are recommended for students to understand. 
In addition to these 10 commands, there are several commands that Linux has, 
totaling 50. We don't have to memorize them, only 10 commands we mush understand.

2. [Regular Expressions - Linux Tutorial 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpyCeSvGh-M)<br>
Some of the commonly used commands with Regular expressions are tr, sed, vi and grep.

^	| matches start of string
$	| matches end of string
*	| matches up zero or more times the preceding character
\	| Represent special characters
()	| Groups regular expressions
?	| Matches up exactly one character
```

3. [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
The most well-known and traditional text editor for Linux is the VI editor. The 
full-screen UNIX vi editor has two modes of operation: Insert mode, which inserts 
entered text into the file, and Command mode, which executes commands that cause 
action to be taken on the file.

4. [How to write a bash script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-gskSl4pwQ)<br>
This tutorial show me how to write a bash script. Linux and macOS users can

Bash scripts make it easier to combine commands into a program. In Bash scripts, 
all commands that are executed from the terminal also function.
