The term "file" refers to a grouping of linked data that is stored on secondary or non-volatile media, such as magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes.
I/O support is offered for a range of storage device types. When a user signs off, the files they have stored on a disk or another type of storage remain 
there. A File Structure must have a predetermined format in order for an operating system to recognize it. The capacity of the operating system to distinguish 
between various file kinds, such as text files, binary files, and source files, is referred to as file type.

5. [Learning the Linux File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIXzJ3Rz9po)<br>
In the first Unix system, the operating system (/) and user home directories (/usr) were stored on separate disks. The numerous /usr/something folders were 
created as a result of the need to relocate some files to other disks as the operating system expanded. The user home directories were transferred from /usr 
to /home once they could afford a third drive.

commands (similar to terminal commands) that may be used to create and delete object files. We can construct 
many targets to compile and remove object, binary files in a single make file. Using Makefile, we can compile 
our project (software) as many times as we want.

3. [C library function - printf()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_printf.htm)<br>
A `cstring` is sent to `stdout` by the C function `printf` (print formatted). Format specifiers (starting with `%`
in the cstring) may be present in the given `cstring`. Return Value: The total number of characters that were written 
to the standard output is returned if the function is successfully invoked. A negative number is returned if there is an error.
`c-string` is the string that was supplied to the function as an argument. If there are any format specifiers in the 
`c-string`, then there may be more arguments after it.<br>
`int printf (const char* c-string, ...);`

4. [Memory Management](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/index.html)<br>
The Linux memory management subsystem is in charge of overseeing the system's memory.

apply the FIFO, optimal, and LRU page-replacement algorithms; describe the working set of a process, and explain how it is related to
program locality; describe how Linux, Windows 10, Solaris manage virtual memory; and design a virtual memory manager simulation in the C programming
language.

2. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of the main memory.
Program-generated addresses are automatically translated into the matching machine addresses, allowing programs to distinguish between addresses used 
by the memory system to identify physical storage sites and addresses used by programs to refer to memory.

3. [What is virtual memory? – Gary explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
In other words the physical representation of memory and virtual memory is equivalent to how inventory is shipped to a warehouse and memory is the amount 
of space the warehouse can store of that shipment. Virtual memory is a shipment being processed to go either in its storage location or to be used in either 
to be once again shipped out or for some function in the warehouse/facility.

4. [Demand Paging](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-demand-paging)<br>
In computer operating systems, demand paging (as opposed to anticipatory paging) is a method of virtual memory management. In a system that uses demand paging, 
the operating system copies a disk page into physical memory only if an attempt is made to access it and that page is not already in memory (i.e., if a page fault occurs).

3. [Operating System - Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)<br>
A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.
`A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.`
When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections ─ stack, 
heap, text and data. The following image shows a simplified layout of a process inside main memory 

4. [Threads in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/threads-in-operating-system)<br>
A thread is also called a thread of execution or a thread of control because it is a single continuous flow that performs the tasks of a process. 
Threads can run within processes on all operating systems. Apart from that, there can be multiple threads within a process. Each thread in the same 
process uses a separate program counter and stack of startup records and control blocks. Threads are often referred to as lightweight processes.

5. [How to Use SCP Command to Securely Transfer Files](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/)<br>
`scp [OPTION] [user@]SRC_HOST:]file1 [user@]DEST_HOST:]file2`

`[user@]DEST_HOST:]file2` - Destination file

6. [fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)<br>
Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() 
call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. 
A child process uses the same pc(program counter), same CPU registers, same open files which use in the parent process.

Processes are classified into one of two types based on synchronization:
```
- Independent Process:
The execution of one process does not affect the execution of other processes.
- Cooperative Process: 
A process that affects or can be affected by other processes running on the system.
Process Synchronization Problems occur in the case of cooperating processes because cooperating processes share resources.
```

5. [Process Synchronization in OS](https://www.scaler.com/topics/operating-system/process-synchronization-in-os/)<br>
Process synchronization, or synchronization, is how the operating system manages processes that share the same memory space. 
Use variables or hardware to maintain data consistency and allow only one process to modify shared memory at a time.

6. [What is a semaphore? How do they work? (Example in C)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukM_zzrIeXs)<br>
Semaphore is an integer variable which is used as a signal to allow or not allow a process to access the critical section of the code or certain other resources. 
There are two types of semaphores: Binary - take on values 0 or 1. Counting - take on any integer value.

7. [Deadlock Dan Starvation](https://www.gurupendidikan.co.id/deadlock-dan-starvation/)<br>

including RAID

2. [Mass-Storage Structure](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/10_MassStorage.html)<br>
Mass storage refers to systems meant to store large amounts of data. In many cases, massive storage is synonymous with peripheral storage, where external devices 
or media help to manage larger amounts of information that have exceeded the capacity of a computer or device's native storage capabilities.

3. [Non-volatile memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory)<br>
Non-volatile memory (NVM) or non-volatile storage is a type of computer memory that can retain stored information even after power is removed. In contrast, volatile memory needs constant power in order to retain data. 
Non-volatile memory typically refers to storage in semiconductor memory chips, which store data in floating-gate memory cells consisting of floating-gate MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors), 
including flash memory storage such as NAND flash and solid-state drives (SSD).

4. [Volatile memory](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/volatile-memory)<br>
Volatile memory, in contrast to non-volatile memory, is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is quickly lost. 
Volatile memory has several uses including as primary storage. In addition to usually being faster than forms of mass storage such as a hard disk drive, volatility can protect sensitive information, as it becomes unavailable on power-down. 
Most general-purpose random-access memory (RAM) is volatile.

5. [Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2595506/redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks.html)<br>
A redundant array of independent disks (RAID) is a common system for high-volume data storage at the server level. RAID systems use many small-capacity disk drives to store large amounts of data and to provide increased reliability and redundancy. 
Such an array appears to the computer as a single logical unit consisting of multiple disk drives.

6. [Firmware](https://techterms.com/definition/firmware)<br>
Firmware is a software program or set of instructions programmed on a hardware device. It provides the necessary instructions for how the device communicates with the other computer hardware.

7. [BIOS function on a computer, know how it works and its types](https://www.merdeka.com/sumut/fungsi-bios-pada-komputer-pengertian-cara-kerja-dan-jenisnya-kln.html)<br>
The BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a personal computer's microprocessor uses to start up the computer system after you turn it on. It also manages the flow of data between 
the computer's operating system and attached devices such as hard drives, video adapters, keyboards, mice, and printers.

8. [What Is UEFI, and How Is It Different from BIOS?](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/htg-explains-how-uefi-will-replace-the-bios/)<br>
BIOS is short for Basic Input-Output system. It’s low-level software that resides in a chip on your computer’s motherboard.

9. [How to Use the chroot Command on Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/441534/how-to-use-the-chroot-command-on-linux/)<br>
A chroot environment provides functionality similar to that of a virtual machine, but it is a lighter solution. The captive system doesn’t need a hypervisor to be installed and configured, 
such as VirtualBox or Virtual Machine Manager.
