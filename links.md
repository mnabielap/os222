## WEEK-00

1. [Operating System Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/index.htm)<br>
An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. 
An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, 
memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral 
devices such as disk drives and printers.

2. [Operating system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
An operating system (OS) is a type of system software that controls how computer hardware 
and software resources are used and offers basic services to other software applications.

3. [Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch1.pptx)<br>
This slide is a good introduction for understanding OS. With this slide I learn 
more about the OS and its environment as well as the hardware

4. [What defines an Operating System?](https://rahmatm.samik-ibrahim.vlsm.org/2021/07/what-defines-operating-system.html)<br>
The operating system is a layer of software that comes preinstalled on computers 
and is responsible for giving user programs a better, simpler, cleaner model of 
the computer and for handling all the resources already described.

5. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
By the beginning of the 1950s, computers had become so quick that manually loading 
programs using punch cards was frequently quicker than actually running them. 
The operating system (or OS), which is only a program with special rights that 
enables it to run and manage other programs, provided the solution.

## WEEK-01

1. [10 Linux Terminal Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU)<br>
There are several Linux commands that are recommended for students to understand. 
In addition to these 10 commands, there are several commands that Linux has, 
totaling 50. We don't have to memorize them, only 10 commands we mush understand.

2. [Regular Expressions - Linux Tutorial 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpyCeSvGh-M)<br>
Some of the commonly used commands with Regular expressions are tr, sed, vi and grep. 
Listed below are some of the basic Regex.
Symbol	Descriptions
```
.	| replaces any character
^	| matches start of string
$	| matches end of string
*	| matches up zero or more times the preceding character
\	| Represent special characters
()	| Groups regular expressions
?	| Matches up exactly one character
```

3. [Basic vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
The most well-known and traditional text editor for Linux is the VI editor. The 
full-screen UNIX vi editor has two modes of operation: Insert mode, which inserts 
entered text into the file, and Command mode, which executes commands that cause 
action to be taken on the file.

4. [How to write a bash script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-gskSl4pwQ)<br>
This tutorial show me how to write a bash script. Linux and macOS users can 
interact with the operating system using Bash, a Unix command line interface. 
Bash scripts make it easier to combine commands into a program. In Bash scripts, 
all commands that are executed from the terminal also function.

## WEEK-02

1. [Operating System Concepts: Security](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch16.pptx)<br>
In this slide, I learn about security threats and attacks; the fundamentals of encryption, 
authentication, and hashing; the uses of cryptography in computing; and the various 
countermeasures to security attacks

2. [Operating System Concepts: Protection](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch17.pptx)<br>
By reading this slide, I understand more about  the goals and principles of protection in a modern 
computer system, how protection domains combined with an access matrix are used to specify the resources 
a process may access, capability and language-based protection systems, and Describe how protection 
mechanisms can mitigate system attacks

3. [Cyber Security Introduction by Eli the Computer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcDO8km6R6c)<br>
By watching this video, I learn more about Point of Cyber Security is to Prevent Loss of Data, 
Prevent Down Time, Prevent Systems from Being Used Nefariously, and Stay Compliant with Laws/ Regulations.
And second thing I learn from this video is Don’t Do Harm. 

4. [Employee Security Policy by Eli the Computer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CivG_2UqKMg)<br>
This video teach me about Employee Security Policy things. Employee Bonding and Buy there are several 
things I learn in this segment, that are Relationships are worth more than products, People telegraph 
their intentions, fire them before they become a problem, Seek to understand employee problems and 
then find where we can yield, Managers are employees too, and Build a network of influencers and get their 
buy-in 

5. [The Beginner’s Guide To Online Privacy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-online-privacy-7149b33c4a3e/)<br>
This website is very useful for beginners to online privacy. After reading this, I learn about The 
Pyramid of Privacy where can teach us to protect our own data from bottom to the top. From OS to Script 
and cookies. In this part, I learn about risk and solution too.

## WEEK-03

1. [Operating System Concepts: File-System Interface](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch13.pptx)<br>
In this slide, I learn about the function of file systems; the interfaces to file systems; 
file-system design tradeoffs, including access methods, file sharing, file locking, and directory structures
; and file-system protection

2. [Operating System Concepts: File System Implementation](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch14.pptx)<br>
By reading this slide, I understand more about  the details of implementing local file systems and directory
structures, block allocation and free-block algorithms and trade-offs, file system efficiency and performance issues, 
recovery from file system failures, and  the WAFL file system as a concrete example

3. [Operating System Concepts: File System Internals](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/PPTX-dir/ch14.pptx)<br>
After reading and learning this slide, I learn more about delve into the details of file systems and their implementation, 
explore booting and file sharing, remote file systems, using NFS as an example.

4. [File Systems in Operating System: Structure, Attributes, Types](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br>
The term "file" refers to a grouping of linked data that is stored on secondary or non-volatile media, such as magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes.
I/O support is offered for a range of storage device types. When a user signs off, the files they have stored on a disk or another type of storage remain 
there. A File Structure must have a predetermined format in order for an operating system to recognize it. The capacity of the operating system to distinguish 
between various file kinds, such as text files, binary files, and source files, is referred to as file type.

5. [Learning the Linux File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIXzJ3Rz9po)<br>
In the first Unix system, the operating system (/) and user home directories (/usr) were stored on separate disks. The numerous /usr/something folders were 
created as a result of the need to relocate some files to other disks as the operating system expanded. The user home directories were transferred from /usr 
to /home once they could afford a third drive.

6. [How to encrypt and decrypt files with GPG?](https://www.thesecuritybuddy.com/pgp-and-gpg/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-files-with-gpg/)<br>
```
To encrypt a file with GPG:

gpg --armor --output output.asc --encrypt --recipient <recipient-userid> <file>

To decrypt a file with GPG:

gpg --output file.txt --decrypt output.asc

To encrypt a file with GPG symmetric key:

gpg --armor --output output.asc symmetric file.txt

To decrypt a file with GPG symmetric key:

gpg --output file.txt -d output.asc
```
